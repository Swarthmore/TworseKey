This is an update of the original project by Martin Kaltenbrunner

Tworse Key is an Arduino-powered Telegraph that transmits its messages to Twitter.  Inspired by Martin Kaltenbrunner's original 2012 project, students, faculty, and staff at Swarthmore College have updated the code to work with the newer Twitter API and added the ability to work with Wifi or Ethernet connections.

The Tworse Key is an open design exercise in interface archaeology,  that decodes the input from a classic Morse key to send twitter messages. This standalone device connects through a standard LAN cable, the Morse signals are decoded by the built-in Arduino Ethernet board, which delivers the final message though the Twitter API. 

This project is fully documented in order to illustrate the Open Design process for beginners, the source code and building instructions are therefore available under the according free licenses. 

This project is using NeoCat's Twitter library:
